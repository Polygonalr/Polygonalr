### Hi there 👋

I am...

- 📖 A soon-to-be-year-4 student studying Computer Science in National University of Singapore, specializing in Parallel Computing and Programming Languages.
- 🌱 A curious learner who is delving into compiler design, low-level systems programming, high performance computing and distributed systems design.
- 💻 A software engineer who has been writing random small apps and games since 2012, with experience in C, C++, C#, Rust, Golang, Python and Java.
- 🌐 A full-stack web developer that has experience with Ruby on Rails, Django and TypeScripted ReactJS.
- 🙆🏻‍♂️ looking for a mentor because I am quite lost in figuring out what I want to do in the future.

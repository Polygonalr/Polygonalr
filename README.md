### Hi there 👋

I am...

- 📖 A year 3 student studying Computer Science in National University of Singapore specializing in Parallel Computing and Programming Languages.
- 🌐 A full-stack web developer, that has experience with Ruby on Rails, Django and TypeScripted ReactJS.
- 🌱 An aspiring Rustacean who is interested in low-level systems programming, parallel computing, distributed systems design and compiler design.
- 🙆🏻‍♂️ looking for a mentor because I am quite lost in figuring out what I want to do in the future.
